# Employee Management System

This project is an Employee Management system built using Servlets and JSP (JavaServer Pages). It showcases my ability to create a web application using traditional Java EE technologies. The application allows for managing employee data, including adding, updating, viewing, and deleting employee information.

## Features:

- Add new employees
- View employee details
- Update employee information
- Delete employees

## Technologies Used:

- Java Servlets
- JSP
- JDBC
- MySQL

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `employee-management` directory.
3. Set up the MySQL database:
   - Create a database named `employee_management`.
4. Update the database configuration in the `db.comfig` file with your MySQL username and password.
5. Deploy the application to a servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat).
6. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080/employee-management`.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to build web applications using traditional Java EE technologies. It was created as part of an internship assessment, and I am pleased to have been offered the position based on this work.
